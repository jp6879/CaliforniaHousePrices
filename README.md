# California Housing Prices

* * *

* This is a very simple example of a Machine Learning project. The goal is to predict median house values in Californian districts, given a number of features from these districts.

* The data is based on the 1990 California census data.

* The project is based on the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

* Uses different regression models to predict the median house price for each district.
